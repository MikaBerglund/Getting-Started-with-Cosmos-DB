# Getting Started with Azure Cosmos DB
This repository is a tutorial for getting started with designing applications that use [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) as data storage. The tutorial mainly focuses on things that you need to take care of during your architecture design and that might be hard or even impossible to change later on.

> Personally, I would have loved to have this kind of a short tutorial before starting my first Cosmos DB project to get me going in the right direction from the beginning.

If you are not familiar with Cosmos DB, you should first read this [overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction).

## Tutorial Structure
This tutorial is split up into the following parts. Each part focuses on a particular subject.

- [Part 1](Part01-readme.md): The development environment.
- [Part 2](Part02-readme.md): Scaling considerations.
- [Part 3](Part03-readme.md): Designing a data model.
- [Part 4](Part04-readme.md): Creating a Cosmos DB database.
- [Part 5](Part05-readme.md): Reading and writing data using the data model.
